# Minimalistic Design Revamp - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Supplier Price List Merger has been transformed from a heavy Aceternity UI design to a clean, minimalistic interface using the provided OKLCH color theme. The design now emphasizes simplicity, readability, and efficiency.

## Design Philosophy
- **Minimalism First**: Removed all unnecessary visual elements and effects
- **Clean Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Subtle Interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions
- **Accessible Colors**: OKLCH color space for better color perception
- **Performance Focused**: Lighter CSS and reduced animations

## New Color System (OKLCH)

### Light Theme (Default)
- **Background**: Pure white (`oklch(1.0000 0 0)`)
- **Foreground**: Dark gray (`oklch(0.2686 0 0)`)
- **Primary**: Lime green accent (`oklch(0.7686 0.1647 70.0804)`)
- **Secondary**: Light gray (`oklch(0.9670 0.0029 264.5419)`)
- **Muted**: Very light gray (`oklch(0.9846 0.0017 247.8389)`)
- **Border**: Light gray borders (`oklch(0.9276 0.0058 264.5313)`)

### Dark Theme Support
- Complete dark theme variants with proper contrast ratios
- Consistent color relationships across themes
- Accessible color combinations

## Component Transformations

### 1. **MinimalButton** (replaced ShimmerButton)
- Clean rounded corners with subtle shadows
- Two variants: primary (lime accent) and secondary (light gray)
- Simple hover states without heavy animations
- Loading states with spinner icon
- Focus states for accessibility

### 2. **MinimalCard** (replaced GlowingCard)
- Simple white background with subtle borders
- Configurable padding (sm, md, lg)
- Gentle hover shadow effects
- No glassmorphism or complex effects

### 3. **MinimalDropZone** (replaced AceternityDropZone)
- Clean dashed border design
- Simple drag and drop feedback
- Status-based color changes (green for success, red for error)
- File type indicators with icons
- Minimal progress animations

### 4. **Simplified Main Page**
- Removed background beams and patterns
- Clean centered layout with proper spacing
- Simplified header with single icon
- Focused file management interface
- Clear progress states

## Removed Elements
- **Background Effects**: No more animated beams or grid patterns
- **Heavy Animations**: Removed complex floating, tilt, and shimmer effects
- **Glassmorphism**: Simplified to solid backgrounds with borders
- **Gradient Text**: Replaced with solid colors for better readability
- **Complex Shadows**: Simplified to standard shadow system

## Technical Improvements
